One well-liked public-key cryptography algorithm for safe online communication is called RSA. The difficulty of factoring huge numbers is the foundation of the RSA algorithm's security.

In order to get a larger number, n = p * q, the RSA technique requires choosing two large prime integers, p and q, and multiplying them. The foundation of RSA's security is the idea that it is challenging to factor such a big number into the prime numbers that make up the algorithm.

A message can be encrypted by the sender using the recipient's public key to make it unreadable. After that, the recipient can decrypt the communication using their private key to restore it to its original format.
